1. Project Definition & Intent

Goal
Build a production-ready portfolio template using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, showing strong fundamentals, clean structure, and professional standards.

Core idea
This is not just a portfolio, but a template that could be reused or adapted. It should feel solid, readable, and intentional.

Key principles

Simple but well-crafted

Accessible and semantic

Responsive by default

Easy to maintain and understand

2. Content & Structure Planning (Before Coding)
Define the sections

Decide early what the portfolio contains. For example:

Home / Intro

About

Projects

Skills

Contact

Do this on paper or in a text file first, not in code.

Content-first mindset

Write real text, not lorem ipsum.
This helps:

Better layout decisions

Better typography choices

Stronger storytelling

Deliverable:

A simple outline of sections and content

3. Semantic HTML Foundation
Goals

Clean, readable HTML

Correct use of semantic tags

Key actions

Use <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>

Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

Include alt text for images

Structure HTML so it works without CSS or JS

Deliverable:

A complete HTML structure with no styling

Page is readable in the browser as plain text

4. CSS Architecture Setup
Base setup

Create a clear CSS structure:

Reset / normalize (simple, not heavy)

Variables (:root) for:

Colors

Fonts

Spacing

Base styles (body, headings, links)

Layout strategy

Use Flexbox and Grid

Mobile-first approach

Avoid fixed sizes when possible

Prefer fluid units (rem, %, vw)

Responsive rules

Start with small screens

Add media queries only when needed

Deliverable:

A clean, readable CSS file

No repeated values (use variables)

Layout works on mobile and desktop

5. Visual Identity & Typography
Typography

Choose 1–2 web fonts (via CDN)

Clear hierarchy: title, subtitle, body text

Good line-height and spacing

Color

Limited palette

Strong contrast for accessibility

Colors defined only in variables

Deliverable:

Consistent visual style across all sections

Readable and calm design

6. JavaScript: Progressive Enhancement
Philosophy

The site must work without JavaScript first.

JS responsibilities

Small interactions only

Examples:

Menu toggle

Scroll-based effects

Simple animations

No frameworks

Best practices

Use defer

Keep JS modular

Comment your code

Deliverable:

One or more JS files with clear purpose

No unnecessary logic

7. Basic Animations & Motion
Goals

Subtle and meaningful motion

No over-animation

Tools

CSS transitions

CSS keyframes

Optional JS-triggered classes

Examples:

Hover states

Section reveal

Button feedback

Deliverable:

Animations that support usability, not distract

8. Accessibility & Quality Check

Checklist:

Keyboard navigation works

Color contrast is readable

Images have alt text

Links are clear and descriptive

Deliverable:

Portfolio usable by different users and devices

9. Version Control & Deployment
Git

Initialize a Git repository

Small, clear commits

Meaningful commit messages

Deployment

Use GitHub Pages or similar

Live URL available

Deliverable:

Public repository

Live deployed portfolio

10. Documentation & Reflection
README file

Include:

Project description

Tech stack

Structure explanation

What you learned

This shows professional thinking, not just visuals.

Final Outcome

At the end of this phase, you will have:

A solid vanilla portfolio template

Clean, semantic code

Responsive layout

A strong base to scale to higher grades

If you want, next we can:

Turn this into a timeline

Adapt it to Second Grade (with tooling)

Or write a README template for the project
